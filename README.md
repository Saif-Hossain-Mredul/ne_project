# Solid state real-time radiation positioning system
In many cases, it is necessary to monitor the location of radioactivity in an area or Hotspots rather than the amount of radiation itself. At present, there is only a few systems that can visually detect radiation from a distant location. Moreover, it is necessary to monitor the radiation level in real time to observe the path of the radioactive element in the human body. The Solid state real-time radiation positioning system achieves these feats by using solid-state radiation detectors placed in a grid or in an array. The sensory elements create a pulse or an analog signal when an incident radioactive particle hits a sensory element. The characteristics of the pulse is then measured and transferred to the server wirelessly. The data is then processed and shown on a display where we can see the shape, size, and movement of a radioactive source element within some finite space. Since the availability of solid-state crystals was not found, we simulated the idea using light-dependent resistors which would detect visible light that is taken as an equivalent to the radiation in this project.
